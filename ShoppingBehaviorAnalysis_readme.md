# 🛍️ Consumer Shopping Behavior Analysis: Python & SQL Integration
Author:  Saee Kadam  EMAIL - saeekadam2909@gmail.com

## 📌 Project Overview
Project performs an end-to-end data analysis of 3,900+ consumer transactions. I utilized **Python** for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization, and **PostgreSQL** for advanced relational database querying. The goal was to identify patterns in customer loyalty, payment preferences, and shipping logistics to drive business revenue.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolstack
* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Database Management:** PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4
* **Environment:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks

## 🗄️ SQL Implementation & Database Design
To demonstrate database proficiency, I migrated the cleaned dataset into a **PostgreSQL** environment. This allowed for high-performance querying and data persistence.

### Key SQL Achievements:
Relational Database Setup: Designed a 'customers' table with optimized data type.
*Business Intelligence Queries:Developed complex SQL scripts to calculate:
    *VIP Segments: Identified high-frequency buyers with above-average spending.
    *Seasonal Revenue Trends: Aggregated total revenue and average order value (AOV) by season.
    *Geographical Analysis: Ranked states by total revenue to identify market expansion opportunities.
    
## 📊 Visual Insights (Python)
I generated several visualizations to answer critical business questions:
Loyalty: Promo code users demonstrate higher repeat purchase rates than non-users.
Demographics: Payment preferences shift by age, with seniors favoring credit and younger demographics using cash.
Logistics: Clothing items dominate the Express Shipping category, suggesting a need for faster inventory turnover in that segment.
Customer Satisfaction: Isolated West Virginia and Oklahoma as regions requiring immediate quality-of-service intervention due to low review ratings.
